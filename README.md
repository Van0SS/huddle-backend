# Huddle

Problem: Increase wellbeing in the workplace
 
Solution: Doing something you want to do, with an associate you haven’t met. Connecting with people around you increases wellbeing. Also professional networking.

Users signup for activities for a set of available times, and are matched one on one with another available associate with the same requirement.

### Concerns:
Don’t be a creep

What if I’m not comfortable going to the gym with another gender?

Try to give everyone a match

### The future
User submitted activities: A platform for people to pitch in ideas anonymously

Group activities, like The Buddy System/meetup

Matching based on common interests

Activities for remote workers
